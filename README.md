# Battleship (Haskell)

This project is a simple, one player command line interface
for Battleship written in Haskell. The game is completely interactive.

#### Compilation:
```
> ghc main.hs
```

#### Usage:
```
> ./main.hs
```

### Purpose
Functional programming was always a very strange concept to me. I decided that the easiest way to understand it's benefits over imperative and object-oriented programming was to build a small little project with it.
